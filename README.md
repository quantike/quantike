### Howdy, I'm @quantike

- 📓 I (occasionally) write on market internals & trading systems on my [substack](https://ikequant.substack.com/p/ikes-thought-process).
- 🐍 I've consistently worked with data in Python for ten years (data engineering, data science, HPC).
- 🦀 I spend much of my time building high-volume, reliable trading systems in Rust.
- ☢️ I studied nuclear physics and my favorite differential equation is (iykyk):

$$\dfrac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\lambda N(t)$$
